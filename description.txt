The Complete Short Sword Class Mod is a mod that adds a lot of new  s
hortswords with new interesting tactic. This tactic consist when you hit any npc with your shortswords you will have a defense boost and potion sickness debuff.

This mod adds a new potion; the titanium skin potion. This potion gives you 15 defense for 1 minute.

Some of the swords are this:

- Wooden Pike: - The most basic shortsword, has 2 damage and gives you a small amount of defense when attack.

- Laser Shortswords: - The small version of lightsabers, it has a secondary attack that gives you feather falling and swiftness buff for some seconds

- Big Syringe: - A weapon that drops the nurse on hardmode, when you attack an enemy, it drains a lot of life from it, but the potion sickness debuff cooldown increases a lot.

- Stick: - The most powerful weapon in the game, it deals more than 2k of damage, and it does a lot of attacks that breaks the game.

With this mod you can craft shortswords with hardmode ores and you can craft the Night's edge swords in small version.

This mod is in pre-alpha and probably i will to add a lot of things like these:

- Calamity and tremor mods shortswords
- Add the new tactic in vanilla weapons.
- Fix bugs
- Accesories
- New shortswords

Any question add me on my discord (Dok#9396).

Download this mod and enjoy the new shortsword system!
