The Complete Short Sword Class Mod is a mod that adds a lot of new 
s
hortswords with new interesting tactic. This tactic consist
when you hit any npc with your shortswords you will 
have a defense boost and potion sickness debuff.

This mod adds a new potion; the titanium skin potion. This potion gives you 50 defense for
25 seconds, perfect to fight with your shortsword.

Some of the swords are this:

- Wooden Pike: - The most basic shortsword, has 2 damage and gives you
.                a small amount of defense when attack.

- Laser Shortswords: - The small version of lightsabers, it has a secondary
.                     attack that gives you feather falling and swiftness buff
.                     for some seconds

- Big Syringe: - A weapon that drops the nurse on hardmode, when you attack an
 .              enemy, it drains a lot of life from it, but the potion sickness
.               debuff cooldown increases a lot.

- Stick: - The most powerful weapon in the game, it deals more than 2k of damage,
.           and it does a lot of attacks that breaks the game.

With this mod you can craft shortswords with hardmode ores and you can craft
the Night's edge swords in small version.
